# Film Query Project

### Overview
This program allows users to interact with a movie database through the console. The interactive menu allows searching for films by their ID or a keyword, searching for actors by their IDs as well by a film ID. Users can view title, description, release year, language, lenght, category, rating and the actors that are in the movie. The database also allows for retrieving additional commercial information about a movie through a secondary menu. 

### Technologies Used
- Java
- OOP
- Maven Dependencies
- MySQL
- JDBC
- MAMP

### How to Run
Compile and run the program from an IDE or a terminal.

### Lessons Learned
MySQL syntax is fun to play with, using technologies such as Maven and JDBC was a fun experience. 
Retrieving multiple data points from the database such as the film search queries was a valuable experience. Combining OOP with databases and displaying the data with neat string manupulation is a satisfying experience.
